# Tripdar — First-Time User Flow

This document describes the canonical first-time user experience flow for Tripdar. It defines the sequence of states and moments a new user encounters, their understanding at each step, and how the system orients them without assumptions about intent or identity.

---

## 1. First-Time User WITHOUT QR Code

### Moment 1: Arrival
The user arrives at Tripdar with no specific entry point. The system recognizes this as a first-time arrival with no contextual anchor. The user understands they have entered a system, but has no information about what it contains or how it functions. The system's intent is to establish presence without presumption—acknowledging arrival while preparing to reveal purpose.

### Moment 2: Purpose Orientation
The system presents the fundamental nature of Tripdar: a reflective, comparative experience system that observes signals and presents stories separately. The user understands that Tripdar is not a game, social network, or transactional platform. They understand that signals (observational data) and stories (narrative content) exist as distinct, non-influencing layers. The intent is to set accurate expectations and prevent misalignment between user assumptions and system reality.

### Moment 3: Source Transparency
The system reveals that it observes ops.originalpsilly.com as its single source of truth, operating in read-only mode. The user understands that Tripdar does not generate or modify the underlying data it presents. They understand that the system's role is observation and presentation, not creation or manipulation. The intent is to establish trust through transparency about data origin and system behavior.

### Moment 4: Experience Scale Introduction
The system introduces the two scales of experience available: macro (comparative and descriptive) and microdose (comparative and reflective). The user understands that these are different modes of engagement, not hierarchical levels or progression paths. They understand that neither scale is superior or required—both are available as distinct ways to engage. The intent is to present options without creating false hierarchies or suggesting required paths.

### Moment 5: Signal Access
The system presents access to signals (Tripdar layer) as the primary observational layer. The user understands that signals are raw observational data from the source, presented without interpretation or modification. They understand that signals are always free and never paywalled. The intent is to establish signals as the foundational layer and clarify their status as open, unmodified observations.

### Moment 6: Story Access
The system presents access to stories (Triptales layer) as a separate narrative layer. The user understands that stories exist independently from signals and never influence signal data. They understand that stories are also free and never paywalled. The intent is to establish stories as distinct from signals while maintaining their open status, reinforcing the separation between observational and narrative layers.

### Moment 7: Comparative Capability
The system reveals that both signals and stories can be viewed comparatively across experiences, but that comparison generates no metrics, scores, or rankings. The user understands that comparison is a tool for reflection, not evaluation or competition. They understand that the system does not measure or judge experiences—it only presents them side-by-side for personal reflection. The intent is to clarify the purpose of comparison as reflective rather than evaluative.

### Moment 8: Navigation Clarity
The system makes clear how to move between macro and microdose experiences, and between signals and stories. The user understands that navigation is available but not required—they can remain in one layer or scale if they choose. They understand that movement between layers does not create dependencies or unlock features. The intent is to provide orientation without creating false urgency or suggesting required actions.

### Moment 9: Interpretation Services (Optional Awareness)
The system optionally reveals that interpretation services, tools, and aggregation may be available as value-added services, but clarifies that raw signals and stories remain free. The user understands that monetization exists only for added interpretation, not for core content. They understand that they can engage fully with signals and stories without any payment. The intent is to be transparent about monetization without creating pressure or suggesting limitations on free access.

### Moment 10: Entry Point Selection
The user is presented with the ability to enter either the signals layer or the stories layer, at either macro or microdose scale, with no default or recommended path. The user understands that their choice is arbitrary and reversible—no path is superior or required. They understand that they can explore freely without consequence or commitment. The intent is to provide agency without guidance, allowing the user to determine their own entry point based on curiosity rather than system suggestion.

## 2. First-Time User WITH QR Code

### Moment 1: Arrival with Context
The user arrives at Tripdar with a QR code that represents a specific signal or story entry point. The system recognizes this as a first-time arrival with a contextual anchor. The user understands they have entered a system at a specific point, but has no information about the broader system or how this point relates to the whole. The system's intent is to honor the entry point while preparing to reveal both the specific context and the system's broader nature.

### Moment 2: Entry Point Resolution
The system resolves the QR code to its corresponding signal or story, and presents that specific content. The user understands they are viewing a particular observation or narrative, but does not yet understand what it represents within the larger system. The intent is to fulfill the promise of the QR code—showing the specific content—while maintaining awareness that broader orientation is still needed.

### Moment 3: Contextual Orientation
The system reveals what type of content they are viewing (signal or story) and how it relates to the source system. The user understands whether they are viewing observational data or narrative content, and understands that this content originates from ops.originalpsilly.com. They understand that this is one piece within a larger system. The intent is to provide immediate context about the specific content while beginning to reveal the system's structure.

### Moment 4: Layer Separation Clarification
The system clarifies that signals and stories are separate layers that never influence each other. If the user arrived at a signal, they understand that stories exist separately and do not modify this signal. If they arrived at a story, they understand that signals exist separately and this story does not modify signal data. The intent is to establish the separation principle even when entering through a specific point, preventing confusion about data relationships.

### Moment 5: System Purpose Orientation
The system presents the fundamental nature of Tripdar as a reflective, comparative experience system. The user understands that Tripdar is not a game, social network, or transactional platform, regardless of how they arrived. They understand that the system's purpose is reflection and comparison, not engagement metrics or social interaction. The intent is to set accurate expectations about the system's nature, even when entering through a specific content point.

### Moment 6: Source Transparency
The system reveals that it observes ops.originalpsilly.com as its single source of truth, operating in read-only mode. The user understands that the content they are viewing (and all content in Tripdar) originates from this source and is not modified by Tripdar. They understand that Tripdar's role is observation and presentation. The intent is to establish trust through transparency, even when the user's initial focus is on specific content.

### Moment 7: Experience Scale Introduction
The system introduces the two scales of experience available: macro (comparative and descriptive) and microdose (comparative and reflective). The user understands that the content they are viewing exists at one of these scales, and that they can view other content at either scale. They understand that scales are different modes, not levels of progression. The intent is to reveal the full range of available experiences while contextualizing their current view.

### Moment 8: Comparative Capability
The system reveals that the content they are viewing can be compared with other signals or stories (depending on which layer they entered), but that comparison generates no metrics, scores, or rankings. The user understands that they can view this content alongside other experiences for reflection, but that the system does not evaluate or rank experiences. The intent is to clarify the purpose of comparison as reflective rather than evaluative, even when starting from a specific entry point.

### Moment 9: Navigation Clarity
The system makes clear how to move to other signals or stories, to the other layer, or to different experience scales. The user understands that they can explore beyond their entry point freely, or remain focused on the content they arrived at. They understand that navigation is available but not required, and that movement creates no dependencies. The intent is to provide orientation without creating pressure to explore, allowing the user to choose their level of engagement.

### Moment 10: Entry Point Status
The system maintains awareness of the user's entry point without privileging it or suggesting it requires special attention. The user understands that their entry point is one of many possible points in the system, neither more nor less important than others. They understand that they can leave it, return to it, or ignore it without consequence. The intent is to honor the entry point without creating false significance, maintaining equality among all content in the system.
