Tripdar Comparative Question Set

Purpose

These are the exact questions Tripdar asks to generate signals. They are designed to:
	•	Elicit comparative responses, not absolute ratings
	•	Map directly to the experiential dimensions
	•	Remain descriptive, never evaluative
	•	Work across the full dose spectrum

Questions produce signals. Signals enable pattern visibility.

Design Principles for Questions
	1.	Always comparative — Every question asks about difference, not magnitude.
	2.	No “how much” — Questions never ask for intensity, strength, or amount.
	3.	Anchored to reference — Comparisons require a reference point (baseline, time, dose shift, or strain).
	4.	Dimension-aligned — Each question maps to one defined experiential dimension.
	5.	Non-leading — Questions do not imply a preferred or desirable direction.
	6.	Dose-aware — Question logic adapts to what meaningfully varies at a given dose category.

Reference Frames

Every comparative question needs an anchor. Tripdar uses the following reference frames:

Reference Frame	Comparison Type	Example Use
Baseline	This experience vs. ordinary waking state	“Compared to how you usually feel…”
Within-strain (dose)	Same strain, different dose	“Compared to a lower dose of this strain…”
Within-strain (temporal)	Same strain, same dose, different time	“Compared to earlier in the day…”
Cross-strain	Different strain, similar dose	“Compared to other strains at this dose level…”

Not all reference frames are active at all doses.

Microdose Note — Temporal Comparison

In microdose contexts, meaningful variation is often temporal rather than dosage-based.

Because microdoses are intentionally sub-perceptual and consistent, Tripdar suppresses dose-shift questions at microdose levels and instead enables time-based comparative questions within a fixed strain × dose context.

This allows Tripdar to capture:
	•	Early vs. later experience
	•	Cumulative feel across a day
	•	Shifts relative to baseline over time

Without introducing:
	•	Metrics
	•	Accumulation scoring
	•	Intensity
	•	New dimensions

Temporal comparison is comparative, descriptive, and dimension-based, and therefore valid.

The Questions

Context Questions (Required)

These establish strain × dose context before dimensional questions.

Question	Purpose
Which strain?	Identifies the strain
Which dose category?	Microdose / Low / Moderate / High
Is this your first experience with this strain?	Determines available reference frames
Have you experienced this strain at a different dose?	Enables dose-based comparison when applicable


⸻

Domain 1: Cognitive

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Clarity	“Compared to your usual state, did your thinking feel clearer or foggier?”	Baseline
Clarity	“Compared to earlier in the day, did your mental clarity shift?”	Temporal (microdose)
Clarity	“Compared to a lower dose of this strain, how did mental clarity shift?”	Within-strain (non-microdose)
Fluidity	“Did thoughts connect more easily than usual, or feel more fixed?”	Baseline
Introspection	“Were you more inward-focused or more outward-focused than usual?”	Baseline
Presence	“Did you feel more grounded in the moment, or was your mind more wandering?”	Baseline


⸻

Domain 2: Emotional

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Openness	“Did you feel more emotionally open or more guarded than usual?”	Baseline
Calm	“Did you feel calmer or more restless than usual?”	Baseline
Calm	“Compared to earlier in the day, did your emotional tone shift?”	Temporal (microdose)
Calm	“Compared to other strains at this dose, did this one feel more calming or more activating?”	Cross-strain
Sensitivity	“Were you more emotionally sensitive than usual, or more neutral?”	Baseline
Warmth	“Did you feel warmer toward others, or more detached?”	Baseline


⸻

Domain 3: Somatic

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Body Awareness	“Were you more aware of your body than usual, or less aware?”	Baseline
Energy	“Did you feel more energized or more subdued than usual?”	Baseline
Energy	“Compared to earlier in the day, did your physical energy shift?”	Temporal (microdose)
Energy	“Compared to other strains at this dose, did this feel more energizing or more sedating?”	Cross-strain
Relaxation	“Did your body feel more relaxed or more tense than usual?”	Baseline
Groundedness	“Did you feel physically grounded, or more unmoored?”	Baseline


⸻

Domain 4: Perceptual

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Visual Nuance	“Did colors, textures, or light seem more vivid, or about the same as usual?”	Baseline
Visual Nuance	“Compared to earlier in the day, did visual awareness change?”	Temporal (microdose)
Visual Nuance	“Compared to a lower dose of this strain, how did visual experience shift?”	Within-strain (non-microdose)
Auditory Texture	“Did sounds feel richer or different, or about the same as usual?”	Baseline
Spatial Awareness	“Did your sense of space or environment feel different, or normal?”	Baseline


⸻

Domain 5: Temporal

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Time Dilation	“Did time feel slower than usual, or normal/fast?”	Baseline
Flow	“Did you lose track of time, or were you very aware of it?”	Baseline
Duration Awareness	“Looking back, did the experience feel longer or shorter than the clock time?”	Baseline

Note: Temporal dimensions remain valid at all doses; temporal comparison becomes especially salient at microdose levels.

⸻

Domain 6: Relational

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Social Ease	“Did you feel more socially at ease, or more withdrawn?”	Baseline
Empathic Attunement	“Were you more attuned to how others were feeling, or more self-focused?”	Baseline
Environmental Connection	“Did you feel more connected to your surroundings, or more separate from them?”	Baseline


⸻

Domain 7: Meaning

Dimension	Question	Reference Frame
Significance	“Did the experience feel meaningful, or did it feel ordinary?”	Baseline
Perspective Shift	“Did you see anything differently afterward, or was your perspective unchanged?”	Baseline
Integration Readiness	“Did it feel like there was something to reflect on later, or nothing particular to process?”	Baseline


⸻

Dose-Shift Questions (Non-Microdose Only)

These questions are suppressed at microdose levels.

Question	Purpose
“What changed most noticeably when you moved from [lower dose] to [this dose]?”	Captures dose-driven dimension shifts
“Which qualities became more present at this dose compared to the lower dose?”	Identifies dose-sensitive dimensions
“Which qualities became less present or disappeared at this dose?”	Captures attenuation


⸻

Cross-Strain Comparative Questions

Asked only when the user has experience with multiple strains at similar doses.

Question	Dimensions Addressed
“Compared to other strains at this dose level, what felt most different about this one?”	Dimension surfaced by user
“Which qualities stood out more with this strain compared to others you’ve tried?”	Dimension salience


⸻

Question Flow Logic
	1.	Context questions — Always asked first
	2.	Baseline questions — Always available
	3.	Temporal questions — Enabled at microdose
	4.	Dose-shift questions — Enabled only above microdose
	5.	Cross-strain questions — Conditional on experience

⸻

What Questions Never Do
	•	Never ask “how intense”
	•	Never ask “did it work”
	•	Never ask “would you recommend”
	•	Never ask “how much”
	•	Never imply a right answer

⸻

Mapping Questions to Signals

Each answered question produces a signal with:
	•	Dimension
	•	Direction
	•	Reference
	•	Context (strain × dose)

Signals aggregate into patterns. Patterns become Tripdar’s language.

Design Implication — Microdose Modeling

In microdose contexts, experiential variation is more meaningfully captured through temporal comparison than through further dose subdivision. This preserves dimensional integrity without introducing metrics or artificial precision.
