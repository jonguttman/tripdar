Tripdar Implementation Brief

Objective
Implement a minimal, compliant prototype of Tripdar that demonstrates:
	•	Signal capture
	•	Signal immutability
	•	Aggregation into pattern language (not metrics)

Non-goals
	•	No auth
	•	No persistence required
	•	No UI polish
	•	No strain comparison yet
	•	No dose switching yet

Required behavior
	•	One strain
	•	One dose
	•	Three dimensions
	•	Baseline reference only
	•	Directional responses only
	•	Aggregation produces descriptive language only

Compliance
All behavior must strictly comply with the documents in /tripdar-spec/.

If a feature would violate those documents, it must not be implemented.
