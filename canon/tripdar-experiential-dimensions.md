# Tripdar Experiential Dimensions Set

## Purpose

These dimensions exist to describe **how experiences differ** — not how good they are, not how intense they are, and not whether they "worked."

Each dimension is a qualitative axis. Users don't rate these. They indicate presence, absence, or relative shift compared to other experiences.

---

## Design Principles for Dimensions

1. **Decomposed, not collapsed** — Each dimension isolates a distinct quality. No dimension should bundle multiple phenomena.

2. **Descriptive, not evaluative** — Dimensions describe what an experience is like, not whether it was successful or desirable.

3. **Comparative by nature** — Dimensions are meant to show how one experience differs from another, not to generate standalone scores.

4. **Inclusive of dose range** — Dimensions must be meaningful across the full spectrum from microdose to macrodose.

5. **Language-first** — Dimensions are expressed through vocabulary, not numbers.

## The Dimensions

*This dimensions set is intentionally incomplete; it captures commonly reported experiential qualities, not the full range of possible effects.*

### Domain 1: Cognitive

How the experience affects thought, awareness, and mental processing.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Clarity** | Sharpness of thought; ability to focus and follow ideas | "clearer than usual" ↔ "foggier than usual" |
| **Fluidity** | Ease of associative thinking; connections between ideas | "thoughts flowed easily" ↔ "thoughts felt fixed" |
| **Introspection** | Tendency toward inward reflection and self-examination | "more self-reflective" ↔ "more outward-focused" |
| **Presence** | Groundedness in the current moment | "very present" ↔ "mind wandering" |
| **Novelty** | Freshness of perception; seeing familiar things differently | "everything felt new" ↔ "everything felt ordinary" |

---

### Domain 2: Emotional

How the experience affects feeling states and emotional texture.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Openness** | Receptivity to feelings; reduced emotional guardedness | "more open" ↔ "more guarded" |
| **Calm** | Sense of peace, stillness, or reduced anxiety | "calmer than usual" ↔ "more restless" |
| **Sensitivity** | Heightened emotional responsiveness | "more emotionally sensitive" ↔ "more emotionally neutral" |
| **Warmth** | Feelings of connection, compassion, or affection | "warmer toward others" ↔ "more detached" |
| **Depth** | Access to layered or buried emotional material | "deeper feelings surfaced" ↔ "stayed on the surface" |

---

### Domain 3: Somatic

How the experience affects body awareness and physical sensation.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Body Awareness** | Attention to physical sensations and internal states | "more aware of body" ↔ "less aware of body" |
| **Energy** | Sense of vitality, activation, or aliveness | "more energized" ↔ "more subdued" |
| **Relaxation** | Physical ease, release of tension | "body felt relaxed" ↔ "body felt tense" |
| **Groundedness** | Feeling physically anchored and stable | "felt grounded" ↔ "felt unmoored" |
| **Sensory Acuity** | Sharpness of physical senses (touch, taste, temperature) | "senses heightened" ↔ "senses muted" |

---

### Domain 4: Perceptual

How the experience affects sensory input and perception of environment.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Visual Nuance** | Noticing color, texture, light, pattern, detail | "visuals more vivid" ↔ "visuals ordinary" |
| **Auditory Texture** | Depth, richness, or altered quality of sound | "sounds richer/different" ↔ "sounds normal" |
| **Spatial Awareness** | Altered sense of space, depth, or environment | "space felt different" ↔ "space felt normal" |
| **Aesthetic Sensitivity** | Heightened appreciation of beauty or form | "more moved by beauty" ↔ "aesthetics unremarkable" |

---

### Domain 5: Temporal

How the experience affects the perception and flow of time.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Time Dilation** | Sense of time slowing down or expanding | "time felt slower" ↔ "time felt normal/fast" |
| **Flow** | Seamless absorption in activity; loss of time-tracking | "lost track of time" ↔ "very aware of time" |
| **Duration Awareness** | Sense of how long the experience lasted vs. clock time | "felt longer than it was" ↔ "felt shorter than it was" |

---

### Domain 6: Relational

How the experience affects connection to others and environment.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Social Ease** | Comfort and naturalness in interaction | "more socially at ease" ↔ "more withdrawn" |
| **Empathic Attunement** | Sensitivity to others' states and feelings | "more attuned to others" ↔ "more self-focused" |
| **Environmental Connection** | Feeling of relationship with surroundings, nature | "more connected to environment" ↔ "more separate" |

---

### Domain 7: Meaning

How the experience affects sense of significance, insight, or perspective.

| Dimension | Description | Comparative Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Significance** | Sense that the experience mattered or carried weight | "felt meaningful" ↔ "felt ordinary" |
| **Perspective Shift** | Changed viewpoint on self, life, or situation | "saw things differently" ↔ "no change in perspective" |
| **Integration Readiness** | Feeling that insights are accessible for later reflection | "wanted to process afterward" ↔ "nothing to process" |

---

## Dimension Behavior Across Dose

Dimensions behave differently at different dose levels. This is expected and valuable — it's how Tripdar shows the difference between micro and macro experiences.

| Dose Category | Typical Dimension Behavior |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Microdose** | Subtle shifts; most dimensions show mild movement; cognitive and emotional domains often most noticeable |
| **Low Dose** | Clearer presence of several dimensions; perceptual and somatic domains begin activating |
| **Moderate Dose** | Most dimensions active; temporal distortion common; meaning dimensions emerge |
| **High Dose** | Strong presence across domains; perceptual and temporal dimensions highly pronounced; relational dimensions may vary widely |

*This is descriptive pattern, not prescription.*

---

## What Dimensions Are Not

- **Not ratings** — Users don't score these 1–10
- **Not outcomes** — Dimensions don't measure success or failure
- **Not universal** — Not everyone will notice every dimension
- **Not prescriptive** — Presence of a dimension is not better than absence
- **Not intensity** — "More" on a dimension is not "more intense" overall

**The absence of a dimension is itself an informative signal and is not treated as a lack.**

---

## How Dimensions Will Be Used

Dimensions enable Tripdar to answer comparative questions like:

- "How does Strain A at microdose typically differ from Strain B at microdose?"
- "What tends to shift when moving from micro to moderate dose with this strain?"
- "Which dimensions are most commonly reported for this strain?"

Dimensions support **pattern language**, not **performance metrics**.

*This document defines the experiential dimensions set. It is a conceptual vocabulary, not a data schema. Schema design follows once dimensions are validated.*

## Watch Points (Governance Notes)

These dimensions require ongoing vigilance to prevent drift toward outcome or evaluative framing.

### ⚠️ Integration Readiness
Currently safe: "Feeling that insights are accessible for later reflection"

**Never allow it to become:**
- Integration success
- Lasting benefit
- Life change

*Must stay about felt availability, not outcome.*

### ⚠️ Significance
Currently safe: Framed without tying to value, importance, or impact.

**Red line:** Any pressure to quantify "meaningfulness" must be refused.

### ⚠️ Domain Count
Seven domains is the ceiling.

**Resist:**
- Adding "just one more"
- Responding to edge cases
- Accommodating outlier experiences

*Tripdar models patterns, not exhaustiveness.*
