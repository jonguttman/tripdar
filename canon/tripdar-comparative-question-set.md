# Tripdar Comparative Question Set

## Purpose

These are the exact questions Tripdar asks to generate signals. They are designed to:

- Elicit **comparative** responses, not absolute ratings
- Map directly to the **experiential dimensions**
- Remain **descriptive**, never evaluative
- Work across the **full dose spectrum**

Questions produce signals. Signals enable pattern visibility.

## Design Principles for Questions

1. **Always comparative** — Every question asks about difference, not magnitude.

2. **No "how much"** — Questions never ask for intensity, strength, or amount.

3. **Anchored to reference** — Comparisons need a reference point (another experience, a baseline, a dose shift).

4. **Dimension-aligned** — Each question maps to one or more defined dimensions.

5. **Non-leading** — Questions don't imply a preferred answer or desirable direction.

6. **Dose-aware** — Questions acknowledge that context (strain × dose) shapes response.

---

## Reference Frames

Every comparative question needs an anchor. Tripdar uses three reference frames:

| Reference Frame | Comparison Type | Example Use |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | This experience vs. ordinary waking state | "Compared to how you usually feel..." |
| **Within-strain** | Same strain, different dose | "Compared to a lower dose of this strain..." |
| **Cross-strain** | Different strain, similar dose | "Compared to other strains at this dose level..." |

Users are never required to have all reference frames available. Questions adapt based on what the user can compare.

## The Questions

### Context Questions (Required)

These establish strain × dose context before any dimensional questions.

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Which strain?** | Identifies the strain being reported on |
| **Which dose category?** | Microdose / Low / Moderate / High |
| **Is this your first experience with this strain?** | Determines available reference frames |
| **Have you experienced this strain at a different dose?** | Enables within-strain comparison |

---

### Domain 1: Cognitive

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Clarity** | "Compared to your usual state, did your thinking feel clearer or foggier?" | Baseline |
| **Clarity** | "Compared to a lower dose of this strain, how did mental clarity shift?" | Within-strain |
| **Fluidity** | "Did thoughts connect more easily than usual, or feel more fixed?" | Baseline |
| **Introspection** | "Were you more inward-focused or more outward-focused than usual?" | Baseline |
| **Presence** | "Did you feel more grounded in the moment, or was your mind more wandering?" | Baseline |
| **Novelty** | "Did familiar things feel fresh or new, or did everything feel ordinary?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 2: Emotional

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Openness** | "Did you feel more emotionally open or more guarded than usual?" | Baseline |
| **Calm** | "Did you feel calmer or more restless than usual?" | Baseline |
| **Calm** | "Compared to other strains at this dose, did this one feel more calming or more activating?" | Cross-strain |
| **Sensitivity** | "Were you more emotionally sensitive than usual, or more neutral?" | Baseline |
| **Warmth** | "Did you feel warmer toward others, or more detached?" | Baseline |
| **Depth** | "Did deeper feelings come to the surface, or did things stay more on the surface?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 3: Somatic

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Body Awareness** | "Were you more aware of your body than usual, or less aware?" | Baseline |
| **Energy** | "Did you feel more energized or more subdued than usual?" | Baseline |
| **Energy** | "Compared to other strains at this dose, did this feel more energizing or more sedating?" | Cross-strain |
| **Relaxation** | "Did your body feel more relaxed or more tense than usual?" | Baseline |
| **Groundedness** | "Did you feel physically grounded, or more unmoored?" | Baseline |
| **Sensory Acuity** | "Were your physical senses sharper or more muted than usual?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 4: Perceptual

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Visual Nuance** | "Did colors, textures, or light seem more vivid, or about the same as usual?" | Baseline |
| **Visual Nuance** | "Compared to a lower dose of this strain, how did visual experience shift?" | Within-strain |
| **Auditory Texture** | "Did sounds feel richer or different, or about the same as usual?" | Baseline |
| **Spatial Awareness** | "Did your sense of space or environment feel different, or normal?" | Baseline |
| **Aesthetic Sensitivity** | "Were you more moved by beauty than usual, or was it unremarkable?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 5: Temporal

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Time Dilation** | "Did time feel slower than usual, or normal/fast?" | Baseline |
| **Time Dilation** | "Compared to a lower dose of this strain, how did your sense of time change?" | Within-strain |
| **Flow** | "Did you lose track of time, or were you very aware of it?" | Baseline |
| **Duration Awareness** | "Looking back, did the experience feel longer or shorter than the clock time?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 6: Relational

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Social Ease** | "Did you feel more socially at ease, or more withdrawn?" | Baseline |
| **Empathic Attunement** | "Were you more attuned to how others were feeling, or more self-focused?" | Baseline |
| **Environmental Connection** | "Did you feel more connected to your surroundings, or more separate from them?" | Baseline |

---

### Domain 7: Meaning

| Dimension | Question | Reference Frame |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Significance** | "Did the experience feel meaningful, or did it feel ordinary?" | Baseline |
| **Perspective Shift** | "Did you see anything differently afterward, or was your perspective unchanged?" | Baseline |
| **Integration Readiness** | "Did it feel like there was something to reflect on later, or nothing particular to process?" | Baseline |

---

## Cross-Strain Comparative Questions

These questions are asked only when the user has experience with multiple strains at similar doses.

| Question | Dimensions Addressed |
|----------|---------------------|
| "Compared to other strains at this dose level, what felt most different about this one?" | Open — maps to whichever dimension the user surfaces |
| "If you had to describe how this strain differs from [specific strain] at the same dose, what would you say?" | Open — comparative pattern capture |
| "Which dimensions felt more present with this strain compared to others you've tried?" | Dimension salience |

---

## Dose-Shift Questions

These questions are asked only when the user has experience with the same strain at different doses.

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "What changed most noticeably when you moved from [lower dose] to [this dose]?" | Captures dimension shift with dose |
| "Which qualities became more present at this dose compared to the lower dose?" | Identifies dose-sensitive dimensions |
| "Which qualities became less present or disappeared at this dose?" | Captures dimension attenuation |

---

## Question Flow Logic

Not all questions are asked every time. Question selection follows this logic:

1. **Context questions** — Always asked first.

2. **Baseline questions** — Asked for all available dimensions; user may skip any.

3. **Within-strain questions** — Asked only if user has same-strain experience at different dose.

4. **Cross-strain questions** — Asked only if user has different-strain experience at similar dose.

5. **Open comparative questions** — Asked at end to capture patterns not covered by structured questions.

---

## What Questions Never Do

- **Never ask "how intense"** — Intensity is a collapsed scalar; Tripdar decomposes, not compresses.
- **Never ask "did it work"** — Outcomes are excluded from the model.
- **Never ask "would you recommend"** — Evaluation and persuasion are forbidden.
- **Never ask "how much"** — Magnitude is not captured; direction and presence are.
- **Never imply a right answer** — No question suggests one response is better than another.

---

## Response Format (Conceptual)

Responses are **not numeric**. They use comparative language:

| Response Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Directional** | "More [X] than usual" / "Less [X] than usual" / "About the same" |
| **Presence** | "Noticed this" / "Didn't notice this" |
| **Salience** | "This stood out" / "This was subtle" / "Not applicable" |

Users may also provide **open text** for questions that invite elaboration. Open text is captured as **story**, not signal, and is stored separately.

---

## Mapping Questions to Signals

Each question, when answered, produces a signal with this structure:

- **Dimension** — Which experiential dimension
- **Direction** — More / Less / Same / Not noticed
- **Reference** — What the comparison was against (baseline, within-strain, cross-strain)
- **Context** — Strain × Dose

Signals aggregate into patterns. Patterns become the language Tripdar uses to describe differences.

*This document defines the questions Tripdar asks. It is a conceptual question set, not a UI or data schema. Implementation follows once the question set is validated.*

## Watch Points (Governance Notes)

### ⚠️ Question Creep
This question set is sufficient. Resist adding questions for edge cases or outlier experiences.

**If a new question is proposed, it must:**
- Map to an existing dimension (no new dimensions)
- Pass all three validity tests (Experiential, Comparative, Informational)
- Not duplicate an existing question's signal

### ⚠️ Intensity Pressure
Pressure will come to ask "how strong" or "how much." This must be refused every time. Direction and presence are the only valid response types.

### ⚠️ Outcome Drift
Questions about whether something "worked" or "helped" will be requested. These belong in stories, not signals. The question set must never include outcome questions.
