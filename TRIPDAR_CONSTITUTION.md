TRIPDAR — CONSTITUTION (v0.1)

Purpose
Tripdar is a reflective, comparative experience system.
It is not a game, a social network, or a growth funnel.

Hard Boundaries
- No gamification (scores, streaks, badges, rankings)
- No retailer comparison or performance metrics
- No pay-to-visibility
- No collapsing Tripdar (signals) with Triptales (stories)
- ops.originalpsilly.com is the single source of truth (read-only)

Experience Scales
- Macro experiences: comparative + descriptive
- Microdose experiences: comparative + reflective

Data Integrity
- Intensity is not a core metric
- Success = clarity, not engagement
- Stories never alter metrics

Monetization Rules
- Raw signals and stories are never paywalled
- Monetization applies only to interpretation, tools, or aggregation

Authority
If a feature violates these rules, it does not ship.
